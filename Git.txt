Three stages of file: committed, modified, and staged.



commands:

pwd	: returns the current working directory

cd	: to change the working directory. (cd~ to go to home)

dir	: list files in directory

copy con	: create a new empty file

mkdir	: to create a new empty folder

git config	: allows you to set configuration like username and email address
		
	git config --global user.name "Shiva Prasad"
	git config --global user.email "shivaprasadcapgemini@gmail.com"
Note: if you want to use different user n email for a particular project, then use the same commands without "--global". But with global it will uplaod project to only that user everytime and no need to use these commands ever again.


git config --list	: to check config list, it will list all the settings git has at that point
git config user.name	: to check only username (u can use for other config too)

man git		: git manual

git help config		: will take you to config commands in git manual

git help	: returns most commonly used git commands
